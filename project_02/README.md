# Project 02

The goal of this project is to compare the performance of a single thread,
a multithread and a multiprocess image filter (in particular, a blur filter).

Future improvements:
- Convolution matrix described in an archive and passed as an argument
- Get the number of virtual processors using a program and use it to define the
  number of threads / processes to be created
